\section{Conclusion}

The primary objective of this thesis was to explore the mathematical foundations of circuit modelling by means of the \emph{Modified Nodal Analysis}. This was done by first formulating a mathematical model from a given circuit topology and then analyzing the resulting system of equations. This system of equations turned out to be of a \emph{Differential Algebraic} structure. This information gave way to finding suitable numerical methods. These theoretical derivations were complemented by worked examples to illustrate the behaviour of different numerical methods when applied to Differential Algebraic systems.

From a mathematical standpoint this analysis is very useful as it can be completely automated. Also adding further components can be done within this setting, as it is described in \cite{ModellingAndDiscretizationOfCircuitProblems}.
