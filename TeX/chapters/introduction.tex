\section{Introduction}
	This chapter should include information about what circuit modelling wants to achieve as well as giving an overview of what this bachelor-thesis is about.

What is this thesis about? \newline
	Modelling and numerically solving systems that arrise from electrical circuits with RLC elements. Furthermore it will briefly discuss on expanding this baseline with more complicated electrical components.
What is the goal of this thesis?\newline
	The goal of this thesis is to give insight into industrial standards concerning circuit modelling. It aims to elaborate on the underlying concepts of MNA as well as on the most commonly used numerical methods.
